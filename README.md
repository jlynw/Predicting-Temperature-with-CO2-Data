# Predicting Demand for Electric Vehicles

## Topic
We are aiming to create a tool to determine the demand of electric vehicle (EV) in the US, by analyzing trends of gasoline prices, income levels and demographics. Electric vehicles have the potential to impact society by lowering fuel costs and reducing emissions. These facets will be used and applied to a machine learning model which will be used to help predict the demand of EVs. Understanding the demand can enable EV suppliers to make educated business decisions in the growing market for electric vehicles.

## Sources of Data:
- [Availability of Charging Stations](https://github.com/moesteelo/Predict-CO2-With-Data/blob/main/Resources/Alternative_Fueling_Stations.csv): This dataset has the location and number of charging stations available in the US.
- [Weekly Gasoline Prices](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_nus_w.htm): This dataset has weekly gasoline prices in the US.

## Communication Protocols:
- Use pandas to clean and perform exploratory analysis on the datasets. Visualize the data to understand relationships between variables, highlight trends, and identify potential outliers or unnecessary data.
- Select and train machine learning model.
- Evaluate the model and determine its accuracy. 
- Use Google Slides and Tableau to communicate analysis.
