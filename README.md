# Predicting Demand for Electric Vehicles

## Topic
We are aiming to create a tool to determine the demand of electric vehicle (EV) in the US, but analyzing trends of gasoline prices, income levels and demographics. Electric vehicles have the potential to impact society by lowering fuel costs and reducing emissions. Understanding the demand can enable EV suppliers to make educated business decisions in the growing market for electric vehicles.

## Sources of Data:
- [Availability of Charging Stations](https://github.com/moesteelo/Predict-CO2-With-Data/blob/main/Resources/Alternative_Fueling_Stations.csv): This dataset has the location and number of charging stations available in the US.
- [Weekly Gasoline Prices](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_nus_w.htm): This dataset has weekly gasoline prices in the US.

## Communication Protocols (may be subject to change):
- Line graph to convey CO2 emissions over time
- Heat map to convey average temperatures over time
