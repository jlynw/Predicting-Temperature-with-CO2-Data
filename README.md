# Demand for Electric Car
Using complex data to create a machine learning model that can be used to gauge the demand for consumer All-Electric (EV) vehicles in the yers to come in the United States. 

## Topic
We are hoping to explore the relationship between CO2 and climate to predict future CO2 levels/temperatures and consequently understand the how these things will affect our habitat in the years to come. We chose this subject as climate change is an unavoidable part of life and being able to understand the ways in which this phenomenon will unfold will be important when planning for the future. With this exploration we plan to understand how climate and  CO2 emissions affect our habitat. 

## Sources of Data (may be subject to change):
- CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset:
  - CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics.

- California Avg Temperatures : NOAA
  - Information on average temperatures in California collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The gathered information has temperature data for each month from the year 1990 to 2021.

## Communication Protocols (may be subject to change):
- Line graph to convey CO2 emissions over time
- Heat map to convey average temperatures over time
